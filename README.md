# The Number Tree

An incremental game made using the game engine The Modding Tree (TMT for short).

Note: if you are annoyed by the different number representations for each currency, just wait. You will unlock upgrades later, such as **Calculator** which provide that conveniece.

Note: each currency has a different number representations because each currency is a type of number system, and each one is displayed in its own form. One example of this is *Roman Numerals*.
